# Getting-started-with-your-Picobot---for-absolute-beginners
A newby guide to getting started with your PicoBot

This is a guide to help you get going with your PicoBot if you have NO programming experience whatsoever. (i.e. ME :-)) This is some of the things that I wished I knew when I was starting out. I have been learning to programme Arduino's for a few months and claim no competence. Just as well as I have none. 

As you are going to be a programmer now, as well as a maker, you might as well start by setting yourself up with a GitHub account. This is where almost all programmers keep their code so they can share it with others, make changes, manage different projects and all sorts of stuff. More importantly, it is where the sample programmes for the PicoBot are. The basic GitHub accounts, all you need for now, are free. An account will allow you to use the code provided simply and also make and save your own changes. You should also download the GitHub programme. (Pros call it 'Git')

Creating an account in GitHub to use example code.

Go to https://github.com/ and Sign Up for a new account. (Miss this is you already have an account obviously!).

Now download Git.

The Windows version is here: https://windows.github.com/
The Mac version is here: https://mac.github.com/

Download a small .exe file and then install. The install process will download a larger (44Mb file).
